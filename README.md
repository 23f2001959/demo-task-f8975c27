# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a fun project to practice your coding skills and challenge your friends to a game of Tic Tac Toe.

## Setup

To set up the game, simply clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/demo-task.git
```

Then, open the `index.html` file in your browser to start playing the game.

## Usage

To play the game, simply click on an empty square to place your X or O. The objective of the game is to get three of your symbols in a row, either vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game will automatically detect if a player has won and will display a message at the top of the board.

## Code Explanation

The game logic is implemented in the `script.js` file. The board is represented as a 3x3 grid in an array, with each cell containing a value of either 'X', 'O', or null. The code handles player turns, checking for a winner, and updating the board accordingly.
